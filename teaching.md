<h1 style="font-size:30px">Teaching</h1>

From primary school to university, I've been fortunate to have met and known many great teachers and mentors. They are **authentic, generous** and **empathetic**, with admirable work ethic and genuine love for their work.  These people have profoundly influenced me and ignited my passion for teaching and outreach.

Over the past seven years, I have participated in numerous teaching and outreach activities. I enjoy sharing my passion for information theory, probability and statistics with younger students. I enjoy simplifying complex topics in an accessible yet rigorous manner to help my students build intuition. Through this process, I often discover new insights. I hope to make helping and inspiring younger students  a recurring theme of my career.
