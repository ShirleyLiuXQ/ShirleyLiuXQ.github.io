<h1 style="font-size:30px">Teaching</h1>

From primary school to university, I've been fortunate to have met and known many great teachers and mentors. They are authentic, generous and empathetic, with admirable work ethic and genuine love for their work. These people have profoundly influenced me and ignited my passion for teaching and outreach.

Over the past decade, I have participated in numerous teaching and outreach activities. I enjoy sharing my passion for probability, statistics and information theory with younger students. I enjoy simplifying complex topics in an accessible yet rigorous manner to help my students build intuition. Through this process, I often discover new technical insights. I hope to make helping and inspiring younger students a recurring theme of my career.
