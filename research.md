My research focus lies in [**statistical learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory) and [**information theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory). 
Specifically, I am interested in applying tools from information theory to (high-dimensional) statistical inference problems, such as  compressed sensing, low-rank matrix estimation, changepoints detection and communications in large user networks. I design efficient algorithms for these  problems, and provide probabilistic guarantees on the tradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error.

I've been particularly interested in studying **message passing algorithms** for the inference problems mentioned above.

I review papers for International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) and International Symposium on Topics in Coding (ISTC).
