My PhD research focused on **statistical learning** and **information theory**. 
Specifically, I was interested in applying tools from information theory and coding theory to high-dimensional statistical estimation problems, such as changepoints detection and random access in large user networks. I study the tradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error from both a fundamental theoretical perspective and an algorithmic perspective.

I've been particularly interested in studying **message passing algorithms** for the estimation problems mentioned above, which is a class of  iterative algorithms that are fast to implement and achieve statistical optimality in various problems. I studied both belief propagation and [approximate message passing (AMP)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9785928) as two types of message passing algorithms.

I review papers for the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) and International Symposium on Topics in Coding (ISTC).
