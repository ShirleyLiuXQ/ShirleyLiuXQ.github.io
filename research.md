My research focuses on **learning theory** and **information theory** in the presence of data heterogeneity. Given the abundance of empirical advances in machine learning and the relative scarcity of theoretical foundations, I believe understanding theoretical limits in estimation and learning problems is crucial for developing more efficient and principled systems. I am particularly interested in investigating such theoretical groundings under **data heterogeneity**, as real-world datasets often vary across geographic locations, time periods, and user populations. For example, I study the fundamental tradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error in changepoint detection and multi-user communication, and I characterize the minimum regret achievable in non-stationary convex bandits.

During my PhD, I focused extensively on **message passing algorithms** for statistical estimation: a class of computationally efficient, iterative methods that can achieve statistical optimality across various problems. I studied both belief propagation and [approximate message passing (AMP)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9785928).

## Interests:
- Data heterogeneity: non-stationarity, contamination, and distribution shifts
- General first-order methods, e.g., gradient descent, approximate message passing
- Online learning and bandits
- Information theory and communication systems
