## Academic:
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford Statistics working 
with [Prof. Patrick Rebeschini](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rebeschi/). My research focuses on **<span style="color:darkred">learning theory</span>** and **high-dimensional statistics**, with particular emphasis on **heterogeneous data** settings. I believe in [Slow Science](http://slow-science.org/).

I have recently been working on three main problems: 

- Design and analyse algorithms for **online learning** where data arrives sequentially and evolves over time; 
- Study the **training dynamics** of neural networks and attention mechanisms, particularly under challenging conditions like non-stationarity, adversarial contamination, and distribution shifts; 
- Black-box methods for post-training **uncertainty quantification** particularly for sequential data. 

I completed my PhD at Cambridge in 2024, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ramji Venkataramanan](https://rv285.github.io/). My PhD work centered on **information theory** and **high-dimensional statistics**, motivated by fundamental questions such as: Given a complex statistical estimation problem, what is the  minimal amount of data we need to estimate the underlying signal? Can we design efficient, mathematically-principled algorithms that approach the minimum? 

Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BA and MEng with distinction in Information and Computer Engineering from Cambridge in 2019. 

I was an intern with 
**Microsoft Research Cambridge** in 2023, where I worked on error correction codes with ML decoding for Project Silica, a novel glass-based data storage technology. This work has recently been accepted to *Nature*.

## Personal:
My first name is pronounced as "Sh-ih-ow Chi" (meaning jade born at dawn in Chinese), but feel free to call me Shirley!

Having lived and worked across four cultures (British, Chinese, Singaporean, and American), I have developed strong adaptability and open-mindedness. I am naturally curious about people from different cultural backgrounds and enjoy learning from their diverse experiences and perspectives. While I am introverted by nature, I have a warm personality and deep sense of empathy. Through leadership roles such as postgraduate representative, I work to bring people together and foster meaningful connections within my community.

Besides work, I like practising yoga.

## Get in touch:
I am actively seeking collaborators on learning theory, statistics and ML. Please send me an email if you are interested in working together!
